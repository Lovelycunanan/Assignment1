    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Born on December 13, 1989, Taylor Swift's full name is Taylor Alison Swift. Taylor Swift developed a passion for music at a young age, perhaps because her grandmother was a successful opera singer. At the age of twelve, she began to create songs and play the guitar. Rolling Stone currently lists her as one of the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-singers-all-time-1234642307/taylor-swift-57-1234643043/">top 200 singers of all time</a>. She also holds 12 Grammy Awards and is currently on the record-breaking Era's Tour.  (Editors & Donica, 2023)

    <h1>Early Career</h1>
    <p>
        When Taylor Swift signed a record deal with Scott Borchetta's Big Machine Records at the age of 14, she earned her start. When her first single, Tim Mcgraw, became popular and reached the Top 10 on Billboard's country chart, she, at the age of sixteen, published her self-titled debut album. In the US, her debut album sold more than a million copies. After that, she opened for a number of performers, including Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, George Strait, and Kenny Chesney. According to Britannicaâ€™s article about Taylor Swift, she awarded the Country Music Association's (CMA) Horizon Award. (Ray, 2023)
        <br><br>
        Her second album, Fearless (2008), was a blend of pop and country music. In the first week of its release, she sold over half a million copies of Fearless, which debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. She received a Grammy nomination the following year for Best New Artist. With Fearless, her album from 2010, she became the youngest artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year.
